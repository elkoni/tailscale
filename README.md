# tailscale
Prevent tailscaled from using ppp* interfaces

My grandma says: " Do not put your finger in every hole, you have seen! ".  
The tailscalde devs seems lack such a gread granny.  
Not every interface is suitable for tailscaled to bind to.  
Build tailscaled by yourself and adapt it to your system, using a patch above  
directly or as a template.  
Seems that TS Devs needs more than four years to implement interface blacklist.
